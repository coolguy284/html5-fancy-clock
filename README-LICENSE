Unlicense does not legally apply in your jurisdiction.

Note: the file "libs/sun-position-2.js", lines 44-139, is a function
faithfully ported (including comments) from StackOverflow. Therefore,
the MIT+Unlicense license of the whole repository does not apply to this
file. Full information on the sun position algorithm code (taken from the
"About" section in this repository's "index.html" file):
The "Stackoverflow" algorithm for calculating the position of the sun
comes from <a href = 'https://stackoverflow.com/a/8764866'>this
stackoverflow page and answer</a>. The algorithm was created by
R. Walraven (Solar Energy. 20:393-397). Then, it was refined by
J.J. Michalsky (Solar Energy. 40:227-235). It was converted into code by

this link</a>, but it is now a 404). Then, some angle errors were corrected
by <a href = 'https://stackoverflow.com/users/980833/josh-obrien'>Josh O'Brien</a>
in <a href = 'https://stackoverflow.com/a/8764866'>the first linked
stackoverflow page and answer</a>. Finally, the code was ported to JavaScript
by me for use in this website.
