ensure nudge ones is disabled for fancy and infospam profiles, as nudging ones gets rid of the point of fixed width printing anyway
add checkbox for smooth second hand
add checkbox for midnight at bottom
precision select
  options minute, second, tenth-second, hundredth-second, millisecond
  milliseconds option puts in the milliseconds in grey super tiny text
add notifications to fancy clock, can toggle them off in settings
  things like "Fall back! (Timezone shifted 1 hour back)" or "Christmas day has begun!" or "Christmas day has ended."
  and they appear in the corner
do east vector as well as zenith vector, and calc zenith vector from cross product of the other 2; then can multiply z coords across the both vectors for oblateness
add ring around clock for day or night illumination, based on a calculation routine that runs when changing location or when next day starts
  precision is minutely by default

vibrant coloring mode
  uses angle of sun to color background with gradient for sky color, that changes throughout day
  text becomes red in night and crimson for past bedtime (gradual fade for both)
    maybe also add stars in bg?

roadmap:
24 hour fancy
  weekday circle - DONE
  day in year circle - DONE
  elevation and azimuth of sun - DONE
  outline outside clock border for sunlight indicator
    yellow for day, blue for night, orange for sunset
  red color when night w. fade
  crimson color when past bedtime w. fade
  background gradient based on sun elevation
  stars when night

low priority:
make numberToStringWithMinimumDecimalPlaces function trim 15th decimal place if it is something crazy like 0.3000000000000002
fix jank settings menu on mobile
add altitude box with support for ft or m (by select) for sun illumination calculation (although angle for daylight should be based on how thick atmosphere appears to be and how much the atmosphere can bend or smth)
button to pop out clock to seperate window so its cleaner or smth
  cause less visual overhead on window (no bookmarks bar, menu bar, or tabs) and makes it so default browser window size isn't tiny (if clock was made into a tiny window)

probably not doing:
attempt a red filter during night using:
  document.body.style.filter='invert(0%) sepia(300%) saturate(7428%) hue-rotate(359deg) brightness(113%) contrast(115%) drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px red) drop-shadow(0px 0px 5px red)'
  (found on stackoverflow somewhere)
