rename mode to profile, and make it a select
  will then add other profiles, like 24 hour fancy, that has additional info, and weekday circle, and day in year circle, and height and angle of sun, and background gradient based on time of day (really just based on sun angle)
  profiles will set visibility of some checkboxes, so only checkboxes that affect current profile will be visible
  make default profile 24 hour fancy
make fixed-width-number text print function to print hours:minutes and such
fix rendering on portrait mode phone
  website should scale based on min of wid and hei not just hei

low priority:
make numberToStringWithMinimumDecimalPlaces function trim 15th decimal place if it is something crazy like 0.3000000000000002
